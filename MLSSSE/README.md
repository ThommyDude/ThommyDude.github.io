## What's this?
I recently got into M&L SSS for the 3DS again and found this save editor but found it slightly lacking in options and data.
So I've updated some things, like showing an approximate lvl convieniently next to the current xp field that already existed aswell as the ability to actually edit the amount of items PER item, instead of having ONLY a button that sets all items to 99.

## This game is multiple years old, aren't you a little late?
It's 2020... I've been out of the programming world for a while, thought it'd be a good way to ease back in. Also, I do what I want!

## Notes
The reason the level field is marked as "approximatly" is due to it being based off the EXP needed for levels from the GBA version. I thought that would be enough but when both Mario and Luigi turned level 12 in-game and I tested my editor, it tells me Mario is still level 11. Turns out the numbers aren't the exact same, OR the tables online are just plain wrong. I am in no mood to try and figure out the real exp needed for every level because I don't have 900 hours to do so.
